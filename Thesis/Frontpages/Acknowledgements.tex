    First of all,  I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my advisor, Associate Professor Kohei Nagai, for the continued support of my master study, for his great support and motivation. This research would not be able to complete without the kind support from him, a supervisor who endured the countless failure and mistakes, and guiding with great patience and kindness.

    My special thanks to Assistant Professor Yuya Sakai, the co-supervisor, for all of his valuable comments and great support in this research.

    Advice given by Project Assistant Professor  Koji Matsumoto has been a great help in developing the programming in this research.

    The author would also like to extend appreciation to the government of Japan for awarding the author a MEXT scholarship to make this project possible.

    And specially thank for my family.
