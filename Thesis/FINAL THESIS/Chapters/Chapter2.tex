\section{Conclusions}

In this chapter describe about the numerical simulation system that has been used in this research, RBSM. In the this study, RBSM is used to simulate the deterioration of concrete due to expansion such as expansion crack, then the mechanical properties of expanded concrete will be calculated by using RBSM.

In RBSM, the response of normal spring and shear spring represent the mechanical response of mortar and aggregate member. By giving initial strain, the response of spring changed in the relatively close manner as real expanded structure. Also the cases that will be simulated in later are introduced in this chapter. The details of simulation results from this simulation will be described again in Chapter 3 and 4.
